    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p>The site name I chose for my web page is "The London Chamber". The reason why I selected it, is because represents a city in which the chamber will operate and is somewhere with which I'm familiar.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>It will have two primary purposes. The first purpose will be business promotion and networking. It will provide a space for businesses to showcase their products and services, share success stories, and engage in networking opportunities. Through this platform, businesses can strengthen their connections, share best practices, and collectively promote economic growth in the region. The second purpose will be related to the community and tourism promotion. In addition to supporting local businesses, "The London Chamber" website will be an informative resource for the broader community and tourists. It will feature comprehensive guides to the attractions, culture, and events in the city. This includes information on local landmarks, upcoming events, and community initiatives. This will bring in visitors and potential investors.</p>

    <h2>Some Scenarios</h2>
    <p>  1 - "I'm a local business owner looking to expand my network. Can I find a directory of member businesses and upcoming business networking events on the website?"</p>
    <p>2 - "I'm planning a visit to London. Can I find information on local attractions, hotels, and upcoming cultural events on the chamber's website?"</p>
    <p>3 - "I'm interested in sponsoring or partnering with the London Chamber for an upcoming event. How can I get more information about sponsorship opportunities and benefits?"</p>
